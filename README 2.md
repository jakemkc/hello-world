Examining blood prssure and glucose in ~500K Indians surveyed in the Demographic and Health Surveys Data


The Challenge:
Associate all DHS survey questions with glucose and blood pressure in males and fmales (separately) in India. Diabetes is an emerging threat in India and this is an urgent issue.
You will be rewarded if the mansucript is ready by 3/31.
Because we should cooperate, let me try and be more concrete about the deliverables, A, B-C, D-E can be done in parallel:
Participants:
Group 1: Kajal, Jake, Grace
Group 2: Braden, Danielle, and Sivateja
Everyone works on A, and Groups 1 and 2 work on the tasks below.
A.) a dataset cleaned up for an R-based analysis
—
Group 1:
B.) XWAS — correlation of each variable against glucose and blood pressure with and without adjustments.
C.) A multivariate prediction of glucose and blood pressure (AUC and pseudo R2).
—
Group 2:
D.) a comparison of blood pressure and glucose in different stratum of the Indian population (age, sex, and region).
E.) sibling correlation estimates of glucose and blood pressure based on family structure in the data.
